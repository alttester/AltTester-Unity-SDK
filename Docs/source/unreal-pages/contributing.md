# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AltTester® Unreal SDK.

## Leave a review

It would help us enormously if you would send a review to [our email](mailto:contact@alttester.com).

## Did you find a bug?

Please [email](mailto:contact@alttester.com) us with the details of the bug.

**When you ask a question about a problem you will get a much better/quicker answer if you provide a code sample that can be used to reproduce the problem.**

Try to:

-   Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem.
-   Provide all parts needed to reproduce the problem (code and model if needed).
-   Test the code you’re about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement?
