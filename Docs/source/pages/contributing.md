# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AltTester Unity SDK.

## Leave a review

It would help us enormously if you would send a review to [our email](mailto:alttester@altom.com).

## Did you find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching all issues.
If you’re unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a [new issue](https://github.com/alttester/AltTester-Unity-SDK/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=).

**When you ask a question about a problem you will get a much better/quicker answer if you provide a code sample that can be used to reproduce the problem.**

Try to:

* Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem.
* Provide all parts needed to reproduce the problem (code and model if needed).
* Test the code you’re about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement?

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn’t exist in AltTester Unity SDK:

* Ensure the enhancement was not already reported by searching all issues.
* Open a [new issue](https://github.com/alttester/AltTester-Unity-SDK/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature-request.md&title=). Be sure to include a clear description of the feature you would like to see, as much relevant information as possible:
  * Why you need it?
  * How should it work?

## Contributing changes

When you create a pull request take in consideration the following:

* Respect the project structure
* If it is a new feature like a new command try to make it for all three languages (Java, C# and Python) and also add tests
* If it is a bugfix then write a test to show that the bug is no longer reproducible
