AltUnity Tools
##############


Through AltUnity Tools, we provide a UI Test Automation solution for Unity games.

- AltUnity Tester is a free, open source asset. Its main goal is to enable UI test automation, by instrumenting games to get access and programmatically control the Unity objects. Get AltUnity Tester from `Unity Asset Store <https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/altunity-tester-ui-test-automation-112101>`_.

- AltUnity Inspector is a desktop application allowing users to inspect the object hierarchy and interact with their app outside the Unity Editor. Get AltUnity Inspector from `our website <https://altom.com/testing-tools/altunitytester/>`_.
