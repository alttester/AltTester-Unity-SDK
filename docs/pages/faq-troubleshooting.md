<summary>Can I use AltUnity Tester to run tests using device cloud services? </summary>
<br>
It works with some of the cloud services. We tried it with Bitbar Cloud and AWS Device Farm.  
These give you access to a virtual machine or a Docker container that has a cloud device attached, where you upload your tests, configure your environment and run your tests. More info about this here:<em><a href=" tester-with-cloud.html"> Running tests using device cloud services.</a></em>

<details>
<summary> Do I need access to the source code of the Unity App to write tests?</summary>
<br>
In order to run tests using AltUnity Tester you require an <a href="get-started.html#instrument-your-game-with-altunity-server">instrumented build</a> of the Unity App. To create an instrumented build of the Unity App you need to <a href="get-started.html#import-altunity-tester-package-in-unity-editor">import</a> the AltUnity Tester package in Unity Editor. 
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary> I don’t have access to source code, but I do have access to an instrumented build. How can I begin to write tests?</summary>
<br>
 We’ve published AltUnity Inspector, which allows you to inspect the game objects outside the unity editor without access to the source code. More information about AltUnity Inspector can be found in this <a href="https://altom.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-altunity-inspector/">article</a>.

<summary> Why do I get an <strong>error when trying to call the port forwarding </strong>methods? </summary>
<br>
You need to make sure the following third party tools are installed: ADB - Android  or iproxy - iOS. For more information you can check our <a href="advanced-usage.html#how-to-setup-port-forwarding">setup port forwarding guide</a>.

<details>
<summary>I get the error: <strong>Multiple precompiled assemblies with the same name Newtonsoft.Json.dll included or the current platform.</strong> </summary>
<br>
You get this error due to multiple imports of Newtonsoft.Json.dll library. You can remove the Newtonsoft.Json version from AltUnity Tester by deleting the <em>Newtonsonft</em> folder <em>Assets/AltUnityTester/ThirdParty/Newtonsonft</em>. 
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary> I get the error: <strong>The type or namespace name 'Newtonsoft' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)</strong>,  </summary>
<br>
You get this error because you don't have a reference to Newtonsoft.Json package.
<br>
Add `"com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json": "3.0.1"` to your project `manifest.json`, inside `dependencies`.

```
{
    "dependencies": {
        "com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json": "3.0.1"
    }
}
```

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary> I get the error: <strong>The type or namespace name 'InputTestFixture' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)</strong>, </summary>
<br>
You get this error because you don't have `com.unity.inputsystem` added as a testables dependency.
<br>
Add `"com.unity.inputsystem"` to your `manifest.json`, inside `testables.`

```
{
    "testables": [
        "com.unity.inputsystem"
  ]
}
```

<summary>How can I <strong>use the Input from AltUnity Tester</strong> if my project is using <strong>Assembly Definitions </strong>?</summary>
